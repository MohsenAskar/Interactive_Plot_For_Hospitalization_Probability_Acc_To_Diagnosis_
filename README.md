# Interactive_Plot_For_Hospitalization_Probability_Acc_To_Diagnosis_
The plot represents the probability to stay in a hospital more than one day considering the diagnosis. The data is aggregated from the Norwegian hospital data (aka the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR)) in three years (2012-2014). The outcome is defined as if the patient stayed in the hospital for one day or more. Colors in the graph indicate the different ICD-10 classification classes. For more on ICD-10, please visit https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes. Use the interactive plot to show/filter the ICD-10 classes. Pointing at each diagnosis will show  diagnosis code, probability and the main ICD-10 class.
